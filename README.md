## 🏗️ Architecture

The framework solves the visual-to-speech problem through a **three-stage decoupled pipeline**, deliberately avoiding direct video-to-waveform generation (which demands massive GPU resources and exhibits high speech distortion):

```
Silent Video → [Mouth ROI Extraction] → [MobileNetV2 Spatial Features] → [BiLSTM Temporal Decoder]
                                                                                    ↓
                                                                            Raw Word Sequence
                                                                                    ↓
                                                                    [T5 LLM Grammar & Spelling Correction]
                                                                                    ↓
                                                                            Refined Sentence
                                                                                    ↓
                                                                    [Offline TTS Engine (pyttsx3)]
                                                                                    ↓
                                                                            🔊 Synthesized Speech
```

### Why Decouple?

A critical challenge in lip reading is **homophenes** — visually identical mouth shapes representing different words (e.g., "p", "b", "m"). Direct visual-to-audio models must resolve these ambiguities in pixel space, which is extremely difficult. Our decoupled design resolves homophenes at the *linguistic* level via the T5 model, leveraging robust language priors to disambiguate.

### Stage Details

| Stage | Component | Purpose |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | **MobileNetV2** (partially frozen, blocks 14–18 fine-tuned) + **2-layer BiLSTM** | Extracts spatial features from mouth crops and models temporal co-articulation across 25 frames |
| 2 | **T5 Transformer** (local, offline) | Corrects spelling/grammar errors in the raw predicted word sequence |
| 3 | **pyttsx3 TTS Engine** | Converts the refined text to audible speech entirely offline |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Trained model weights: `lipreading_model.pth` (place in project root)
- OpenCV Haar Cascade (bundled with `opencv-python`)

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AlekhyaGangopadhyay/Lip2Speech_ReVox.git
cd Lip2Speech_ReVox

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Inference

Run the CLI test script on a sample video:

```bash
python test_video.py lbad8p.mpg
```

Or use the inference module directly:

```bash
python inference.py --video pgby4n.mpg
```

### 3. Sample Videos

Two sample videos from the GRID Corpus are included for testing:

| File | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `lbad8p.mpg` | Sample GRID utterance |
| `pgby4n.mpg` | Sample GRID utterance |

## 🔬 Research Context

### Dataset

This system is trained and evaluated on the **GRID Corpus** — a structured audiovisual dataset containing 33,000 video-transcript pairs with a 51-word vocabulary in a fixed command grammar (e.g., *"set blue at f two now"*).

> **Note:** The GRID Corpus provides a controlled environment to validate the architectural design. The constrained vocabulary makes this system ideal as a **proof-of-concept for high-frequency assistive commands** (e.g., medical assistance requests, basic control interfaces). Scaling to unconstrained vocabularies via LRS2/LRS3 datasets is a planned future direction.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Frame-Wise Classification over CTC Loss:** Instead of using Connectionist Temporal Classification (which introduces training instability and compute overhead), we use simplified frame-wise word alignment padded with silence tokens. The T5 post-processor recovers semantic integrity without requiring heavy decoding algorithms.

2. **Standardized Assistive Voice:** The current TTS implementation uses `pyttsx3` with a standardized voice, prioritizing **intelligibility and latency** over speaker-specific characteristics — consistent with traditional assistive device design.

3. **Haar Cascades over dlib:** By replacing `dlib` (which requires CMake/C++ compilation) with OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers, the system achieves maximum portability across operating systems and low-power hardware with zero compiler dependencies.

### Comparison with Existing Methods

| Method | Limitation | Lip2Speech Advantage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **LipNet** (CTC-based) | Heavy compute, compile dependencies (dlib/CMake), higher WER for short words | Lightweight MobileNetV2 + BiLSTM, compiler-free, T5 refinement |
| **AV-HuBERT** (Transformer) | Large model, GPU-intensive, unsuitable for offline edge | CPU inference ~2s, fully offline |
| **Cloud Speech APIs** | Requires internet, transmits sensitive data | 100% local, privacy-guaranteed |
| **Traditional TTS Keyboards** | Requires manual typing, slow | Direct visual-to-speech, natural flow |
