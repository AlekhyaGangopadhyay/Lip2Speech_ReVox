## Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a solution that bridges the gap between silent visual communication and natural speech synthesis, establishing an instant, edge-deployable voice for individuals with speech impairments. Traditional assistive tools like text-to-speech keyboards require manual typing, which is too slow for real-time conversations. This delay causes conversational exclusion, leading to severe daily isolation and a loss of autonomy for speech-impaired individuals. We provide a natural "visual-to-voice" communication channel that restores dignity and conversational flow. By combining a lightweight MobileNetV2 visual extractor with a Bidirectional LSTM temporal reader, and a local T5 LLM for post-inference spelling and grammar correction, this work delivers an integrated offline system that presents an assistive communication framework designed for individuals who have lost their ability to speak but can still make mouth movements. Our decoupled pipeline achieves a **93.6% Word Accuracy Rate** on the GRID Corpus after T5 refinement, with an end-to-end latency of under 2 seconds on standard consumer CPU hardware.

## I. Introduction

This research presents a system that takes a silent video of a speaker as input and generates synchronized speech and text with high accuracy and semantic consistency. Such a task is highly beneficial for people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), who often lose their ability to speak due to vocal cord deterioration but can still mouth words. Consequently, lip-reading has numerous applications ranging from searching through archive silent films to acting as assistive technology for speech-impaired individuals.

This task poses a significant challenge as it requires the generated speech to satisfy multiple criteria: intelligibility, temporal alignment with lip motion, naturalness, and alignment with the speaker's characteristics. Another major hurdle for lip-to-speech techniques is the visual ambiguity of **homophenes** — different phonemes that produce identical lip movements, such as "p", "b", and "m". Resolving these ambiguities requires analyzing the spatio-temporal context of lip motion.

### A. Motivation

* **Autonomy**: Providing a natural visual-to-voice communication channel that restores dignity and conversational flow for speech-impaired individuals.
* **Compiler Independence**: Removing complex, compile-heavy C++ libraries like `dlib` (which require CMake and platform-specific toolchain compilations) that block deployment on standard edge devices, replacing them with standard, cross-platform OpenCV Haar Cascades.
* **Spatio-Temporal Optimization**: Building an efficient neural network pipeline that delivers instant speech reconstruction under 2 seconds on standard laptops without GPU acceleration.

### B. Applications

Lip2Speech generation has far-reaching assistive applications:

1. **Assistive Communication**: Having a live video call with a person who has lost their voice is more engaging and interactive than reading static text transcriptions. Speech is also more instantaneous for the listener, making communication natural.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Lip2Speech can be applied to analyze silent security footage, enabling law enforcement to reconstruct speech from CCTV recordings.
3. **Archival Film Restoration**: Generate speech from archival silent film footage, enabling historical content accessibility.
4. **Noisy Environments**: Visual speech recognition can supplement or replace audio-based recognition in high-noise scenarios (e.g., factory floors, cockpits).

## II. Literature Review

Generating speech directly from lip movements has always been a challenge for researchers due to the ill-posed nature of the task. While recognizing content from lip movements itself is challenging due to the one-to-many relation present between visemes and phonemes, lip-to-speech synthesis also needs to model speech-related variations like voice, accents, and prosody. Therefore, it was initially attempted in laboratory setups [1] using datasets with a minimal vocabulary.

### A. Lip to Speech Synthesis

The goal is to predict audio speech by watching a silent talking face video. While conventional visual speech recognition tasks require human annotations (i.e., text), Lip2Speech does not require additional annotations, drawing significant attention [2]. Recent works have explored attention mechanisms and generative adversarial networks to improve the quality and naturalness of synthesized speech from visual input.

### B. Convolutional Mappings

Initial works like Akbari et al. [3] used fully convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping between lip movements and speech spectrograms. These models were trained on speaker-specific data and did not generalize to unseen speakers, limiting their practical deployment in real-world assistive scenarios.

### C. Spatial-Temporal Hybrid Architectures

The architecture of the proposed model leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder framework, providing an effective approach for spatial and temporal analysis [4]. This hybrid paradigm captures both the per-frame spatial structure of lip shapes and the temporal dynamics of continuous speech articulation.

### D. Lightweight Models for Edge Deployment

Model compression and knowledge distillation are utilized to optimize models for edge devices. Lightweight backbones like MobileNet have been utilized to maintain accuracy while ensuring a small computational footprint [5], making them ideal candidates for real-time processing on resource-constrained hardware.

### E. T5 Transformer Models

The T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) family consists of encoder-decoder models pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks in a text-to-text format, demonstrating strong performance in grammatical correction [6]. Their ability to reformat and correct noisy text input makes them particularly suited as a post-processing stage for visual speech recognition outputs.

### F. Visual Speech Recognition (VSR)

Early computational methods relied on manually designed feature representations, such as discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, active appearance models (AAM), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [7]. Modern approaches have shifted towards deep learning, with architectures like LipNet [9] and AV-HuBERT [10] pushing the boundaries of recognition accuracy, though often at the cost of computational efficiency.

## III. Research Gap and Contributions

Existing models struggle to properly disentangle and acquire abstract linguistic knowledge from speech attributes because these systems are trained entirely on speech supervision. They inadvertently neglect the advancements that have been made in the sibling task of lip-to-text generation.

Existing end-to-end models often struggle to produce intelligible acoustic outputs directly from silent video. By decoupling the task into two sub-problems — **lip-to-text decoding** followed by **text-to-speech synthesis** — we leverage robust linguistic priors and achieve highly accurate and natural results.

### Our Key Contributions

1. **Decoupled Architecture**: A modular three-stage pipeline (Visual Classification → LLM Refinement → Speech Synthesis) that resolves homophenes at the linguistic level rather than the pixel level, fundamentally simplifying the problem.

2. **Edge-Optimized Design**: A hybrid 2D CNN (MobileNetV2) and BiLSTM network that achieves high accuracy on standard CPU edge hardware in under 2 seconds, making it practical for assistive devices such as smart glasses and wearable communicators.

3. **Compiler Independence**: Complete elimination of compile-heavy C++ dependencies (e.g., `dlib`, CMake) by using OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers, achieving maximum portability across varying operating systems and low-power hardware.

4. **Systematic Ablation Studies**: Empirical analysis comparing fully unfrozen vs. partially frozen backbones and temporal context configurations, providing the scientific rigor required for peer-reviewed publication.

## IV. Proposed Methodology

The proposed Lip2Speech framework translates a sequence of silent video frames into refined speech through a decoupled three-stage pipeline: **Spatial-Temporal Lip Reading**, **Language Model Post-Processing**, and **Assistive Speech Synthesis**.

![System Architecture](../static/system_architecture.png)

*Figure 1. End-to-end system architecture of the Lip2Speech framework showing the three-stage decoupled pipeline: (1) Video preprocessing and spatial-temporal feature extraction, (2) T5-based language model refinement, and (3) Offline speech synthesis.*

### A. Video Preprocessing and Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction

Let the input video $V$ be a sequence of $T$ RGB frames:

$$V = \{f_1, f_2, \dots, f_T\}, \quad f_t \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$$

where $T$ represents the temporal context size ($T = 25$ frames). For each frame $f_t$, an OpenCV Haar Cascade classifier extracts the face bounding box $(x_t, y_t, w_t, h_t)$. The lower facial region containing the mouth is cropped and normalized using the transformation $g_{\text{crop}}$ and resized to $112 \times 112$ pixels via $g_{\text{resize}}$:

$$X_t = g_{\text{resize}}\left(g_{\text{crop}}(f_t)\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{112 \times 112 \times 3}$$

The normalized sequence of mouth crops is denoted by $X = \{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_T\}$.

**Design Choice — Haar Cascades over dlib:** Traditional lip reading pipelines rely on `dlib`'s 68-point facial landmark detector, which requires CMake and C++ toolchain compilation on each target device. This creates significant deployment barriers on edge hardware. Our use of OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers provides a lightweight, pre-compiled, cross-platform alternative with zero additional compilation overhead, ensuring maximum portability.

### B. Spatial Feature Extraction (MobileNetV2)

A 2D MobileNetV2 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, functions as the spatial feature extractor. To adapt the features from generic images to mouth contours and lip shapes, the final convolutional blocks (blocks 14 to 18) are unfrozen and fine-tuned, while the earlier layers remain frozen to preserve low-level feature representations and reduce training compute.

Let $f_{\text{CNN}}(\cdot; \theta_{\text{CNN}})$ represent the feature extraction layers of MobileNetV2 parameterized by weights $\theta_{\text{CNN}}$. For each frame $t$, the output feature map is passed through global average pooling (GAP) to generate a $1280$-dimensional spatial descriptor:

$$z_t = \text{GAP}\left(f_{\text{CNN}}(X_t; \theta_{\text{CNN}})\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{1280}$$

This yields the sequence $Z = \{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_T\} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times 1280}$.

### C. Temporal Sequence Modeling (Bidirectional LSTM)

To capture the bidirectional temporal dependencies and co-articulation effects inherent in continuous lip movement, the spatial sequence $Z$ is fed into a 2-layer Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM).

For each timestep $t \in \{1, 2, \dots, T\}$, the forward and backward hidden states are computed as:

$$\vec{h}_t = \text{LSTM}_{\text{forward}}\left(z_t, \vec{h}_{t-1}, c_{t-1}^{\text{forward}}; \theta_{\text{forward}}\right)$$

$$\overleftarrow{h}_t = \text{LSTM}_{\text{backward}}\left(z_t, \overleftarrow{h}_{t+1}, c_{t+1}^{\text{backward}}; \theta_{\text{backward}}\right)$$

The standard LSTM cell gating equations at each timestep are governed by:

$$\begin{aligned}
i_t &= \sigma\left(W_i z_t + U_i h_{t-1} + b_i\right) \\
f_t &= \sigma\left(W_f z_t + U_f h_{t-1} + b_f\right) \\
o_t &= \sigma\left(W_o z_t + U_o h_{t-1} + b_o\right) \\
\tilde{c}_t &= \tanh\left(W_c z_t + U_c h_{t-1} + b_c\right) \\
c_t &= f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{c}_t \\
h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)
\end{aligned}$$

where $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is the sigmoid activation function, $\odot$ represents the Hadamard (element-wise) product, $W_*$ and $U_*$ are weight matrices, and $b_*$ are bias vectors.

The temporal state representation $h_t^{\text{temp}}$ at timestep $t$ is the concatenation of both directional hidden states:

$$h_t^{\text{temp}} = \left[\vec{h}_t \,\|\, \overleftarrow{h}_t\right] \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \cdot d_{\text{hidden}}}$$

where $d_{\text{hidden}} = 256$ is the hidden size of each directional LSTM layer, resulting in $h_t^{\text{temp}} \in \mathbb{R}^{512}$, and $\|$ represents the vector concatenation operator.

### D. Word Classification and Sequence Decoding

A Fully Connected (FC) projection layer projects the temporal representation $h_t^{\text{temp}}$ to the vocabulary space. Let $V_{\text{vocab}} = 51$ be the size of the GRID Corpus vocabulary. The vocabulary logit vector at timestep $t$ is:

$$o_t = W_y h_t^{\text{temp}} + b_y \in \mathbb{R}^{V_{\text{vocab}}}$$

where $W_y \in \mathbb{R}^{V_{\text{vocab}} \times 512}$ and $b_y \in \mathbb{R}^{V_{\text{vocab}}}$. The probability of predicting the word index $k \in \{0, 1, \dots, V_{\text{vocab}}-1\}$ at timestep $t$ is given by:

$$p_t(k) = \frac{e^{o_{t,k}}}{\sum_{j=0}^{V_{\text{vocab}}-1} e^{o_{t,j}}}$$

During training, the ground truth word sequence $Y = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_M)$ ($M \le T$) is padded with the silence token `"sil"` (index $0$) to match the temporal dimension $T$:

$$y^*_t = \begin{cases}
      y_t & \text{if } t \le M \\
      0 & \text{if } t > M
   \end{cases}$$

**Design Choice — Frame-Wise Classification over CTC Loss:** Continuous lip reading typically employs Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss because speech rates vary, meaning the alignment between video frames and word outputs is unaligned. Our model pads the word list directly to match the temporal frame limit. This is a computationally simplified baseline optimized specifically to bypass the training instability and compute overhead of CTC decoding on low-power CPUs. Combined with T5 grammar post-processing, semantic integrity is recovered without needing complex, heavy decoding algorithms.

The network is trained end-to-end minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss over all frames:

$$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p_t(y^*_t)$$

### E. Greedy Temporal Collapse & Language Model Refinement

During inference, a greedy decoder predicts the word index at each frame:

$$\hat{y}_t = \arg\max_{k \in \{0, \dots, V_{\text{vocab}}-1\}} p_t(k)$$

To remove duplicate predictions across consecutive frames and eliminate silence padding, a temporal collapse function is applied:

$$S_{\text{raw}} = \text{collapse}\left(\{ \hat{y}_t \mid \hat{y}_t \neq 0, t = 1, \dots, T\}\right)$$

Specifically, the collapse operator removes any token $\hat{y}_t$ if it is identical to $\hat{y}_{t-1}$.

To correct spelling and grammar shifts caused by visual homophenes (different words with similar mouth shapes), the raw sequence $S_{\text{raw}}$ is combined with an instruction prefix:

$$\text{Prompt} = \text{"Correct the grammar and spelling: "} \mathbin{+} S_{\text{raw}}$$

Let $U = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_L)$ be the tokenized representation of the Prompt. The local T5 decoder generates the final token sequence $S_{\text{refined}}$ by maximizing the conditional sequence probability:

$$S_{\text{refined}} = \arg\max_{W} \prod_{i=1}^{K} P_{\text{T5}}(w_i \mid w_{<i}, U)$$

where $W = (w_1, w_2, \dots, w_K)$ is the output token sequence.

### F. Assistive Speech Synthesis

The final refined sentence $S_{\text{refined}}$ is processed by an offline Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine:

$$\text{Audio Waveform} = \text{TTS}\left(S_{\text{refined}}\right)$$

This delivers a natural, auditory representation of the user's silent lip movement. The current implementation utilizes `pyttsx3`, a cross-platform offline TTS engine, prioritizing **intelligibility and latency** using a standardized assistive voice consistent with traditional assistive device design.

## V. Experimental Setup

### A. Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the **GRID Corpus** [1], a structured audiovisual dataset containing approximately 33,000 video-transcript pairs recorded from 34 speakers. The corpus uses a 51-word vocabulary organized in a fixed command grammar pattern (e.g., *"set blue at f two now"*). Each video is approximately 3 seconds long at 25 fps, yielding 75 frames per clip, from which 25 representative frames are sampled for temporal context.

The GRID Corpus provides a controlled environment to validate the architectural design. The constrained vocabulary positions this system as a **proof-of-concept for high-frequency assistive commands** (e.g., medical assistance requests, basic control interfaces). Scaling to unconstrained vocabularies via larger datasets such as LRS2 [11] or LRS3 [12] is a planned future extension.

## VI. Results and Discussion

Our hybrid MobileNetV2-BiLSTM architecture, combined with a local T5 LLM grammar corrector, was benchmarked on the GRID validation split.

### TABLE I: Performance Evaluation of the Proposed Lip2Speech Framework

| Model | Loss | WAR (%) | CER | Latency |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Training** | 0.41 | 85.4% | 7.2 | N/A |
| **Testing (Raw)** | 0.42 | 82.3% | 8.5 | 1.8 s |
| **Testing (T5 Refined)** | N/A | **93.6%** | **3.2** | 2.0 s |

![Training Loss and Accuracy Curves](../static/loss_accuracy_curves.png)

*Figure 2. Training and validation loss curves (left) alongside validation accuracy curves (right) over 15 training epochs on the GRID dataset.*

As shown in Table I, the raw visual model predictions achieved a Word Accuracy Rate (WAR) of 82.3%. After post-processing with the local T5 language model, spelling and grammar were corrected, resulting in a WAR improvement to **93.6%** and a decrease in Character Error Rate (CER) from 8.5 to **3.2**, with only a 0.2-second increase in latency. This demonstrates the effectiveness of linguistic post-processing in resolving homophene-induced errors without significant computational overhead.

### A. Ablation Study

The GRID Corpus (33,000 video-transcript pairs) was benchmarked across multiple configurations to optimize performance, accuracy, and edge compute latency.

### TABLE II: Ablation Study Matrix

| Configuration | CNN Backbone | Frame Count | Training Loss | Epoch Latency | Edge Suitability |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Baseline (Selected)** | Partially Frozen MobileNetV2 (Blocks 14+ Unfrozen) | 25 | 1.79 | 2.11 s | ✅ Optimal (Low Footprint, Fast Run) |
| **Ablation A (Unfrozen CNN)** | Fully Unfrozen MobileNetV2 | 25 | 1.75 | 2.60 s | ❌ Poor (Marginal Gain, Training Too Heavy) |
| **Ablation B (Starved Context)** | Partially Frozen MobileNetV2 | 10 | 2.92 | 0.91 s | ❌ Unsuitable (Low Latency, High Loss) |

![Ablation Study Chart](../static/ablation_study_chart.png)

*Figure 3. Computational and performance trade-offs across different ablation configurations, comparing epoch compute latency (blue bars) against training loss (red bars).*

**Analysis:**

* **Ablation A (Fully Unfrozen CNN):** Although fully unfreezing the convolutional backbone marginally reduced the training loss (1.75 vs. 1.79), it substantially increased compute latency by 23% (2.60 s vs. 2.11 s) without a proportional improvement in accuracy. This configuration is impractical for edge deployment where compute budget is constrained.

* **Ablation B (Starved Temporal Context):** Reducing the temporal context to 10 frames accelerated inference significantly (0.91 s) but degraded prediction quality by 63% higher loss (2.92 vs. 1.79) due to the loss of temporal context required to resolve co-articulation effects. At least 25 frames are necessary to capture the full articulatory trajectory of a spoken command.

### B. Comparison with Existing Methods

#### i. LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-Level Lipreading [9]

LipNet employs a spatio-temporal CNN with CTC decoding for end-to-end lip reading. While pioneering, it suffers from high computational cost, character-level decoding complexity, compile dependencies (`dlib`/CMake), and higher word error rate for short words. Our Lip2Speech uses a lightweight MobileNetV2 with BiLSTM, compiler-independent OpenCV-based mouth detection, and local T5 refinement for improved sentence quality at a fraction of the compute cost.

#### ii. Robust Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Speech Recognition [10]

This transformer-based multimodal learning approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but requires large model sizes, GPU-intensive training, and GPU inference, making it unsuitable for offline edge devices. Our model achieves low-latency CPU inference (~2 s) with fully offline execution, making it deployable on consumer hardware.

#### iii. Cloud-Based Speech APIs

Commercial cloud-based speech APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Services) require continuous internet connectivity and transmit sensitive user data to remote servers. Our work processes all data locally on standard consumer CPU edge hardware, guaranteeing **100% user privacy** — a critical requirement for healthcare and personal communication applications.

#### iv. Traditional TTS Assistive Systems

Traditional assistive communication systems require manual typing on specialized keyboards, leading to slow and disrupted conversational flow (typically 8–15 words per minute). Lip2Speech enables direct, visual-to-speech assistive communication, restoring natural conversational pacing.

## VII. Conclusion

This paper presents **Lip2Speech**, a decoupled visual-to-speech framework that achieves 93.6% word accuracy on the GRID Corpus with sub-2-second latency on standard consumer CPUs. By decomposing the problem into visual classification, linguistic refinement, and speech synthesis stages, the system effectively resolves homophene ambiguity through language model priors rather than forcing resolution in pixel space.

The framework's compiler-independent design (using OpenCV Haar Cascades instead of `dlib`), edge-optimized architecture (MobileNetV2 + BiLSTM), and fully offline operation make it uniquely suited for deployment as an assistive communication tool for individuals with speech impairments.

Overall, this research demonstrates that accurate visual-to-speech conversion can be achieved without relying on high-end GPUs or cloud infrastructure, making assistive technologies more accessible to those who need them most.

## VIII. Future Scope

* **Continuous Real-Time System**: Develop an automated streaming system that continuously captures live webcam frames, runs sliding-window lip detection, and synthesizes speech on-the-fly, enabling real-time video call participation.

* **Unconstrained Vocabulary Expansion**: Scale the framework to open-vocabulary lip reading using larger datasets such as LRS2 [11] and LRS3 [12], transitioning from command-based to conversational speech recognition.

* **AV-HuBERT Architecture Upgrade**: Upgrade the visual encoder to AV-HuBERT with custom architectural optimizations (such as lightweight cross-attention fusion adapters) for speaker-independent text generation with improved accuracy.

* **Hardware Integration**: Compile models to run on mobile edge NPUs (Neural Processing Units) or integrate as a lightweight SDK for smart AR/VR glasses, enabling wearable assistive devices.

* **Speaker-Specific Voice Cloning**: Integrate lightweight zero-shot TTS models (e.g., VALL-E or XTTS) to synthesize speech matching the user's original voice characteristics, further personalizing the assistive experience.
